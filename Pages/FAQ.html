        <div class="FAQ">
        <h2>General Questions</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>How can I get a quote?</summary> 
            Simply visit the signup flow to book a cleaning and as you provide information 
            about your house and schedule, your quote will dynamically adjust.                              
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Am I charged the full quoted amount even if it doesn't take that long to clean my house?</summary> 
            SNo, you’re only charged based on the amount of time your cleaner was actually at your home working. If they 
            finish early, you aren’t charged the full amount quoted.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Does someone have to visit my house before I can book a cleaning?</summary> 
            Absolutely not! We wouldn’t want pushy sales people coming to our house so we would never do that to you. You 
            can get a quote and book your cleaning online. It takes about one minute.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Are cleaning supplies included?</summary> 
            Cleaning supplies aren’t included by default. This ensures your cleaner uses the products you like and there isn’t any cross-contamination from house to house.

However, if you don’t have supplies, we can bring them for an additional charge of $10 per visit 
($15 for move-in/out cleanings). You can opt-in to this option from your customer dashboard. Also, you can click 
here to see a list of items to have on hand. Please note: we always use your vacuum and mop/bucket so please 
be sure to have those items on-hand.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What if I'm not happy with my cleaning?</summary> 
            Please get in touch with us right away and we’ll make arrangements to rectify the situation.
             We have a satisfaction guarantee that we stand by.                            
        </details>

        <h3>Scheduling Questions</h3>

        <details>
            <summary>CAN I GET A SAME-DAY BOOKING?</summary> 
            we don’t guarantee same-day bookings. But, depending on the day, 
            we can often meet this requirement.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>DO I HAVE TO BE HOME FOR MY CLEANING?</summary> 
            It’s completely up to you. If you’re not going to be home, make sure you let us know how to access 
            your house by putting the information in your customer dashboard.                             
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>DOES MY CLEANER ARRIVE AT THE EXACT TIME I BOOK?</summary> 
            Yes, most of the time. However, we allow a one-hour window due to traffic and weather circumstances. 
            In scenarios where your cleaner will be late, you will be contacted to let you know the ETA.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>WHEN AM I CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE?</summary> 
            You are not charged until after the cleaning has been completed. Your invoice will reflect only the amount of time that your cleaner 
            was actually at your home working, rounded-up to the nearest 15 minute increment.                            
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>ARE THERE NAY COMMITMENTS OF CONTRACTS?</summary> 
            No, you can cancel service anytime without any penalties. You don’t have to commit 
            to any contracts or pre-determined number of appointments.                           
        </details>
